# Subtitle translator
Chrome Extension to translate subtitles on the fly with Google Translate. 

## 0.1 
Only works from Swedish to English on SVT Play. You need to enter your own Google API key in content.js

## 0.2
Settings window for 
* API key
* From/To language
* Support for Netflix
* Setting for showing/hiding original subtitles

## 1.0
Big version jump but made it less "BETA" so think it deserves it.
* Added support for CMORE
* Added settings for font-size
* Added teardown functions so it can be toggled on/off instead of reloading page.

## 1.1
Added support for Disney+.

## Plan forward
* Being able to find subtitle holder by user entering currently visible text
* Do away with Google Translation key. Use chrome.identity? (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/identity/)
